# FreeCodeCamp: Build A Personal Portfolio Webpage

This project involves building a basic portfolio page.

Instead of Bootstrap, I chose to use Semantic-UI and mimic the style of my [personal website][personal]. To add a bit of flavor, I also made the page fully responsive by using a combination of Semantic's grid and css media breakpoionts.
